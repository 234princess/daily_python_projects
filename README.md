Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data : The aim of today's lesson was to cover the basic but important functions in python. This lesson taught me how
to give python information using 'print', how to recieve information using 'input' and how to manipulate strings using 'concatenation'. Today's lesson also introduced
me to data types, types programming errors, debugging, commenting  and variable creating rules.
