Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data : The aim of today's lesson was to cover the basic but important functions in python. This lesson taught me how
to give python information using 'print', how to save information using 'input' and how to put strings together 'concatenation'. Today's lesson also introduced
me to data types, programming errors and variable creation rules.
